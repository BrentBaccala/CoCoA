<li><b><a name="interrupt">When can a computation can be interrupted?</a></b><br>
	In principal, a <b>running</b> computation can always be interrupted. However, a computation that seems
	to be running, may in fact have terminated a while ago. The reasons for this lies in the architecture
	which will be explained below.
	<p>
	CoCoA consists of two components, the engine and the interface. These two components are both running
	in separate threads and communicate asynchronously. Whenever the engine produces output, it posts an
	event to the event queue of the interface, which then processes these events. Let's explain this using
	a short example:
  <pre>
  For I := 1 To 20000 Do
    Print I, " ";
  EndFor;
  </pre>
	After you execute this command set, the engine produces text events which are then processed by the
	interface. However, while the interface is processing these events, the engine might already have
	terminated. But if that is the case, there is not computation to interrupt anymore. And thus you can't
	stop the output from appearing.
</li>
<li><b><a name="measuring_time">Measuring execution time</a></b><br>
	In addition to CoCoAs builtin <b>Time</b> keyword which measures the time the CoCoA engine needs to complete
	a computation, CoCoA shows the total time needed to execute a command set and show the results on the screen
	after each computation in the status bar. Because of the asynchronous architecture of CoCoA mentioned above
	these times might differ greatly.
</li>
<li><b><a name="interactive_close">Interactive Document Close Dialog</a></b><br>
	When you try to close CoCoA a dialog will be shown warning you that any unsaved changes to the Interactive
	Document will be lost if you continue. You can prevent the showing of this dialog by selecting
	"Don't show this dialog again". However, if you decide you want to see this dialog again everytime you quit
	CoCoA, you have to quit CoCoA and change the <b>1</b> in the line
<pre>
  showInteractiveDocumentCloseWarning=1
</pre>
	of the configuration file (which is normally named .xcocoarc or wincocoa.ini) to a <b>0</b>.<br>
	A future version of CoCoA will let you change this in the standard configuration dialog.
</li>
