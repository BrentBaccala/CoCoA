# Script for running the CoCoALib tests (after they've been compiled).
# This script is normally called by make as part of the target "check";
# it is not really intended to be called manually.

# For each executable called test-XYZ (where XYZ can be changed) there may
# be some other related files:
#   test-XYZ.in   -- sample input for the test program
#   test-XYZ.out  -- expected output (on cout) from the test program
#   test-XYZ.err  -- expected output (on cerr) from the test program

# When test-XYZ is run, its output is placed into two files:
#   test-XYZ.cout -- actual output (on cout) from the test program
#   test-XYZ.cerr -- actual output (on cerr) from the test program
# A correct test should always exit with code 0; if the executable exits
# with a non-zero code, this is regarded as a failure.  If the exit code
# is 0 then the actual output is compared with the expected output.
# If they match then test-XYZ.cout and test-XYZ.cerr are deleted,
# otherwise a failure message is printed, and the files are not deleted.

# The output files are compared using "diff -wq" to work around a
# gratuitous incompatibility introduced by Microsoft.
