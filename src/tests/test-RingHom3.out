Simple test on polynomial ring hom
RingWithID(3,"ZZ[x[0],x[1]]")  -->  RingWithID(6,"RingWithID(2)[x[0],x[1]]")
sending x[0]  to  x[0]^2  and
sending x[1]  to  x[1]^2
x[0] +2*x[1] in RingWithID(3,"ZZ[x[0],x[1]]")  maps to x[0]^2 +2*x[1]^2 in RingWithID(6,"RingWithID(2)[x[0],x[1]]")
x[0]^2 +2*x[1]^2 in RingWithID(6,"RingWithID(2)[x[0],x[1]]")  maps to x[0]^4 +2*x[1]^4 in RingWithID(6,"RingWithID(2)[x[0],x[1]]")
x[0]^2 +2*x[1]^2 in RingWithID(6,"RingWithID(2)[x[0],x[1]]")  maps to x[0]^4 +2*x[1]^4 in RingWithID(4,"RingWithID(2)[x[0],x[1]]")
x[0] +2*x[1] in RingWithID(3,"ZZ[x[0],x[1]]")  maps to x[0]^2 +2*x[1]^2 in RingWithID(5,"RingWithID(2)[x[0],x[1]]")
