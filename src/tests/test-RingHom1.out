Composite homomorphism is RingHom(ZZ --> RingWithID(2,"FFp(7)"))

Using composite hom: 1 maps to 1 in RingWithID(2,"FFp(7)")
Using composite hom: 2 maps to 2 in RingWithID(2,"FFp(7)")
Using composite hom: 3 maps to 3 in RingWithID(2,"FFp(7)")
Using composite hom: 4 maps to 4 in RingWithID(2,"FFp(7)")
Using composite hom: 5 maps to 5 in RingWithID(2,"FFp(7)")
Using composite hom: 6 maps to 6 in RingWithID(2,"FFp(7)")
Using composite hom: 7 maps to 0 in RingWithID(2,"FFp(7)")
Using composite hom: 8 maps to 1 in RingWithID(2,"FFp(7)")
Using composite hom: 9 maps to 2 in RingWithID(2,"FFp(7)")
Using composite hom: 10 maps to 3 in RingWithID(2,"FFp(7)")
