This is the README file for the directory CoCoALib/src/server/.

**WARNING** the server code has lain idle for a long time now (May 2013)

Date: 22 May 2005

In this directory you will find the file CoCoAServer.C.  To compile the
server run the command "make server" from the COCOA_ROOT directory; running
the command "make" in this directory should have the same effect.

The CoCoA server can be called via a socket from CoCoA-4.6 (and later versions).

When the server is running it will reply to all requests from any CoCoA-4.6
running on the same machine: one single server can handle requests from
many users.  CoCoA-4.6 can also be set to call a server running on another
computer.  (see instructions in the CoCoA-4.6 manual).

The protocol used for communication is "vaguely" inspired by OpenMath.

For developers: to generate a table of timings
  make benchmarks
New benchmarks for the server should be added to BenchmarkSrc.cocoa

The files SocketStream* implement a C++ interface to POSIX style sockets.
