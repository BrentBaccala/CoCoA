hey!!!   write something more!


I'm just using the C code I wrote for CoCoA-4.
It will be entirely rewritten in C++

The only usable function is
```  RingElem HilbertNumeratorMod(PolyRing HSRing, ideal I);

but it works ONLY if I is a monomial ideal.
HSRing is the ring where the Hilbert Series Numerator should live.
