<b>CoCoA5 language</b>
We shall need a new parser (and interpreter) for CoCoA 5.  Much of the
design of the new language has already been completed, and a late prototype
of the new lexer already exists.  The new parser and interpreter are now
at first prototype (i.e. stage (2abc)).  This task should split into
several more focussed smaller tasks.
Roughly the recent news are:
<ul>
<li>design of the language, problems about global variables, ....
<li>August 2010: prototype GUI/IDE with debugger, portability.
<li>September 2010: polynomial rings
<li>October 2010: functions returning lists
<li>November 2010: functions on rings and RingElems
<li>December 2010: tested and ported functions on lists from cocoa4 packages
<li>January 2011: homomorphisms
<li>February 2011: matrices
</ul>

<b>NumTheory file names</b>
After renaming ZZ/QQ to BigInt/BigRat (so that ZZ/QQ are reserved for the
corresponding rings) it no longer makes sense for <code>NumTheoryQQ</code>
to have the QQ suffix.  Find a better name for it, and perhaps for <code>NumTheory</code>
too.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2012-02</i>
<b>Rename "RingZ/RingQ" to "RingZZ/RingQQ"?</b>
Since we use ZZ/QQ in CoCoA-5, it would make sense for the fns
<code>RingZ/RingQ</code> to be called <code>RingZZ/RingQQ</code>
as this is more coherent.  Decide and, if favourable, implement.
Time est.: 2 days.
<font color="blue">Abbott+Bigatti</font>

<p>
<i>2012-02</i>
<b>Rename "ZZ/QQ" into "BigInt/BigRat"</b>
There is a name collision between cocoalib ZZ, type name for big
integers, and cocoa ZZ, the ring of integers; the same occurs for QQ.
It took a long time to decide the new names, and the decision is for
BigInt and BigRat to replace ZZ and QQ in cocoalib.  Many consequential
changes.
Try using GMPXX implementation for BigInt?

<b>Rename "MachineInteger" into "MachineInt"</b>
Choosing BigInt as the new name for the class ZZ suggests to change all
classes and functions with "Integer" into "Int"... hidden surprises?
We hope not..
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>

<b>DecimalStr</b>
New fn: <code>DecimalStr</code> with slightly cleaner semantics than
the one implemented in CoCoA-4.

</p>

<p>
<i>2011-05-17</i>
<b>Task Table: conversion into XML</b>
The HTML version of the task table was too tedious to update.
The conversion into XML (with C++ code to create the HTML pages) 
should encourage us to update it more frequently making the whole lot
more meaningful.
<font color="blue">Bigatti</font>
</p>

<i>2011-05-09</i>
<b>Integration of C code for Toric Ideals</b>
This implementation is NOT ROBUST and NOT THREAD-SAFE, but it works
(needed for the CoCoASchool)
<font color="blue">Bigatti</font>

<i>2011-04-10</i>
<b>CoCoA5 manual</b>
The manual for cocoa5 will still use the CoCoAHelp.xml file and
structure.  The html and the latex version will use the same xsl code,
  and the online version is treated by ad-hoc code in CoCoA-5:
  OnlineHelp.[HC].
  This has survived for long enough with just minor improvement and no
obvious design holes.  So I consider it done!

<b>Examples and tests use cout/cerr</b>
Example programs and tests now use the standard C++ iostreams (rather than
GlobalOutput and so on).  This change makes the code easier to understand, and
prepares the way for moving GlobalOutput etc into the server directory.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2010-11-11</i>
<b>GlobalManager incorporates GMPMemMgr</b>
GlobalManager significantly revised.  It now creates GMPAllocator internally
(if told to do so).  New simpler interface for ctor of GlobalManager.
Updated documentation accordingly.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2010-10-29</i>
<b>Memory leak on test-hilbert1</b>
After the recent improvement of GlobalManager and Reference Counting
a sort of memory leak resulted in test-hilbert1: it was
the global variable with precomputed powers of polynomials.

<p>
<i>2010-03-22</i>
<b>New version 0.9937</b>
New version to signal the fixing of many minor
bug and the embarrassing bug in subtraction of a machine integer from
a <code>ZZ</code>.  Upgrading strongly recommended.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2010-03-22</i>
<b>Tests and bug fixes for ZZ</b>
Added tests for <code>ZZ</code>.  Fixed several bugs which were discovered.

</p>

<p>
<i>2010-03-22</i>
<b>Add iterator classes for continued fractions</b>
Two new classes: one for producing the partial quotient, the for producing
the convergents.  I've preferred simplicity of ultimate speed.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2010-03-18</i>
<b>Add ctors for ZZ and QQ from a string</b>
Done.

<p>
<i>2010-03-18</i>
<b>Example using <code>monomial</code></b>
Added <a href="../examples/index.html#ex-PolyRing2.C">ex-PolyRing2.C</a>
showing how to write a simple function to pass exponent vectors
to the function <span class=func>monomial</span>.
This way looks more natural than calling
<span class=func>power</span> many times when writing complicated
power-products.
<font color="blue">Bigatti</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2010-03-18</i>
<b>Rational coeffs in <code>monomial</code>, also for principal ideals</b>

<font color="blue">Bigatti</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2010-03-10</i>
<b>Revised CoCoALib build system</b>
The <code>configure</code> script now works better, and will get some compilation
flags automatically from the GMP header file.  Solved a problem about
GMP version number (on Werner's new computer).
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2010-03-05</i>
<b>New pseudo-ctors for polynomial rings</b>
Added new pseudo-ctors for polynomial rings which accept <code>PPOrderingCtor</code>
values; this makes it easier for the user to specify the ordering.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2010-03-05</i>
<b>Multiplicative Order Modulo an Integer</b>
Added new function to <code>NumTheory</code> for computing the
order of an element in the multiplicative group of coprime residues
modulo an integer.

<p>
<i>2010-02-15</i>
<b>Random machine integers</b>
Added new class <code>RandomLongStream</code> to represent generators of
random machine integers (in a given range).
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2010-02-10</i>
<b>Revised CoCoALib build system</b>
The <code>configure</code> script now works better, and will get some compilation
flags automatically from the GMP header file.  Also makes it relatively to specify
a specific compiler and/or compilation flags.

<b>ZZ max/min bug</b>
Removed the proxy class <code>ZZ::rtn</code> which caused a SEGV bug
(see <code>test-bug4.C</code>).  May lead to poor performance for
arithmetic on ZZ values.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-12-23</i>
<b>Further refinement to conversion functions: <code>NumericCast</code></b>
Added new conversion function <code>NumericCast</code>.  This is just a
placeholder for the corresponding feature in the BOOST library.  Also
added two new conversions from QQ to machine integers.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-12-11</i>
<b>New version 0.9934</b>
New version because changes to <code>convert</code> are not backward compatible.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-12-11</i>
<b>Rename the function <code>convert</code> into <code>IsConvertible</code></b>
The new name gives a clearer indication of what it does.  Introduced a procedure
called <code>convert</code> which throws in case of failure; there is a new error
<code>ERR::BadConvert</code> for these failing cases.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-12-03</i>
<b>Rename EFGModule into FGModule?</b>
The emphasis on the word "effectively" seems useless here.
When an object name suggests a property that property is effective.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-10-29</i>
<b>New version 0.9933</b>
A new version number because the handshaking introduced in the CoCoAServer
is not backward compatible (with CoCoA 4.7.5 or earlier).
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-10-29</i>
<b>Implement proper handshake at end of session CoCoA4-CoCoAServer</b>
Modified CoCoAServer and the communications part of CoCoA4 so that
they effect a proper handshake at the end of the session.  This seems
to solve the (intermittent) problems observed on some Linux boxes
(where a race condition could let the socket die too early).

<p>
<i>2009-10-28</i>
<b>Convert sugar into inheritance classes</b>
There are different kinds of sugar (StdDeg, wdeg,
saturating,..): an abstract class representing gives
clean code for the reduction process, and possibly also to the
GroebnerMill.
<font color="blue">Bigatti</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-10-08</i>
<b>RoundDiv function for pairs of integers</b>
Added a new function for computing the rounded quotient of pairs of integers.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-09-28</i>
<b>Unique implementation for div and deriv</b>
Like for other functions, also <code>div</code> and <code>deriv</code> have
a unique implementation in SparsePolyRing.C instead of 3 copies in the
DistrMPolyXX.C files.

rows of weights (with i &lt= GradingDim)
<font color="blue">Bigatti</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-07-30</i>
<b>Constructors for ideals</b>
We used to have
<tt>ideal(ring), ideal(ring, RingElem), ideal(ring, vector<RingElem>)</tt>.
Now we have other nice constructors
<tt>ideal(RingElem), ideal(vector<RingElem>)</tt> 
the last returns en error when vector is empty.
<tt>ideal(RingElem, RingElem), ...</tt>
up to 4 RingElems
<font color="blue">Bigatti</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-07-15</i>
<b>Round, floor, ceiling</b>
Make ordered rings offer round, floor & ceiling functions (since these cannot
be implemented efficiently using the existing interface).  This was actually completed
some time ago (but I forgot to update the task table).
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-07-08</i>
<b>Improved QQ</b>
Improved the QQ implementation: added functions <code>floor</code> and <code>ceil</code>.
Corrected the embedding of QQ values into RingTwinFloat.  Added <code>ex-QQ1</code>
example program.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-07-02</i>
<b>New Version</b>
Made version <span class=version>0.9931</span>
in recognition of the substantial changes since the previous version (see below).
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>

<p>
<i>2009-07-02</i>
<b>New class for rationals</b>
Added the new class <code>QQ</code> for representing rational numbers.
There are some basic arithmetic operations too.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-07-02</i>
<b>Improved NumTheory</b>
Varius functions in the recent NumTheory file have been improved: <i>e.g.</i>
better
interface, fewer bugs, clearer documentation.  Thanks to the participants of the recent CoCoA
School in Barcelona whose opinions help answer some philosophical design questions.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>

<b>New Version</b>
Made version <span class=version>0.9930</span>
in recognition of the substantial changes since the previous version.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-06-05</i>
<b>Basic Number Theory Functions</b>
Basic number theory functions (such as <tt>gcd</tt> and <tt>lcm</tt>) have been
put together in a new file (namely <tt>NumTheory.C</tt>); some were simply moved
from <tt>ZZ.C</tt> while others are new.  The function signatures have been
made more coherent, and more complete (<i>i.e.</i>allowing machine integers and
ZZs to be used interchangeably).  The <tt>IsPrime</tt> function now works
over a wider range.  <tt>IsPPrime</tt> has been renamed to <tt>IsProbPrime</tt>
as the new name is more meaningful and memorable.  Added several new functions:
<tt>EulerPhi</tt>, <tt>PrimitiveRoot</tt>, <tt>SmoothFactor</tt> and <tt>factor</tt>.
Added a new template class <tt>factorization</tt> to hold the results of factorizations.
The code should also work correctly on both 32 and 64 bit computers (but in fact does not, sigh).
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-05-20</i>
<b>Improved printing for residues (in quotients of Z)</b>
There is now a global option for specifying whether elements of a
quotient of ZZ are printed as least non-negative residues or as
least magnitude residues.  The default is least magnitude (a change
from the previous deault behaviour).  The residues are now always
printed without brackets -- previously brackets were used in some
cases and not in others.
<font color="blue">Abbott+Bigatti</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-05-20</i>
<b>Faster Makefiles</b>
Modified the Makefiles to use the archiver <tt>ar</tt> in a more
economical manner; this make partial recompilation usefully faster.
The Makefiles have been cleaned/improved as well.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-02-20</i>
<b>Documentation converted to txt2tags</b>
CoCoALib documentation is written in pure text.  Using
txt2tags we can keep it clean/readable while allowing pretty
formatting and linking into HTML and TeX.
Proper polishing will take some time.

<p>
<i>2009-02-13</i>
<b>Better matrix examples</b>
The example <span class=file>ex-matrix1.C</span>

<b><tt>configure</tt> arguments</b>
Version <span class=version>0.9928</span>.
(1) Configuration for optimization/debugging
 using <code>--flags=ARG</code>.
(2) Configuration for linking frobby
  using <code>--with-libfrobby=ARG</code>
and added tests (just to check the linking has been successful) in
  cocoalib and cocoa4.

<p>
<i>2009-02-09</i>
<b>New: abstract class for sugar</b>
Version <span class=version>0.9927</span>.
First prototype for abstract class for sugar.  Still unused, but
makefile, dependencies and library.H had to be changed.
<font color="blue">Bigatti</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-01-30</i>
<b>Enum instead of bool arguments in GReductor</b>
GReductor constructor had many boolean arguments: they have been
converted into more meaningful "enum"s.
<font color="blue">Bigatti, Caboara</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-01-30</i>
<b>Frobby integration</b>
Version <span class=version>0.9926</span>.
First check-in for Frobby files.  Configuration process not properly
defined yet, but all code is in the right place and compilation flag
is set.  Makefile, dependencies and library.H had to be changed.
<font color="blue">Bigatti, Roune</font>
</p>

<p>
<i>2009-01-14</i>
<b>Improve configure script</b>
Configure behaves badly when gcc exists but g++ does not.
Fix the script so that it works gracefully in both cases.
One or two problems still remain (e.g. 64-bit on Mac G5)

<b>Machine integers in place of RingElems</b>
Now using <code>MachineInteger</code> type whenever a machine integer value is
used in place of <code>RingElem</code>.  This avoids nasty surprises when C++
silently converts signed values into unsigned (or <i>vice versa</i>).

<p>
<i>2008-12-11</i>
<b>Revised symbol</b>
Now using <code>MachineInteger</code> type in ctors to specify the values of symbol indexes
(but we check that the values fit into a <code>long</code>).  Corrected two bugs in
SymbolRange (an undetected overflow and an off-by-1 error).
This improvement needed the update to <code>MachineInteger</code> values.
<font color="blue">Abbott</font>

<b>Updated MachineInteger</b>
Revised <code>MachineInteger</code>.  Fixed a bug, and added the new

<b>Reorganized SOI/NBM, server changed too</b>
SOI/NBM now reside in their own separate file.  Implementation has been
tidied considerably, and enjoys a better structured organization.  Each
algorithm now offers three coherent interfaces, while the actual work is
done by a single implementation of each underlying algorithm.

<b>Preprocessing is now rational, server changed too</b>
The preprocessing algorithms are now rational, so give exact results (rather
than the rational aproximations produced when all input data were converted
into <code>double</code>s).  The speed of computation remains essentially unchanged.

<b>Fixed ideal inheritance code for RingWeyl</b>
version <span class=version>0.9922</span>.

The missing <span class=class>ideal</span> constructor in
<span class=class>RingWeyl</span> caused the ideal to be generated by
the default constructor in <span class=class>SparsePolyRing</span>
(the code is identical).
So the ideal did not call the specific RingWeyl::ideal operations.
Now test-RingWeyl1 checks that 1 is in GBasis(ideal(x, dx)).

<i>2008-10-08</i>
<b>Error Codes</b>
version <span class=version>0.9921</span>.
Error messages need to be expressive, but also short.
To help non-english speakers, each error should
produce an alphanumeric key/code which can be used to search in a manual of errors.
We want to create an "index" of all coded errors with a more verbose
explanation.  Possibly it should also include some information about
the most common occurences of a given error and some suggestions for
debugging and/or fixing it.
See <span class=file>CoCoAErrorCodes.html</span>:
<a href="http://cocoa.dima.unige.it/cocoalib/CoCoAErrorCodes.html">CoCoA
  web page</a> or
<a href="CoCoAErrorCodes.html">local link in <code>doc/</code></a>.
<br>
Moreover the way to check the type of error in an ErrorInfo object has
been changed (and herein lies the backward incompatibility). The new
way should be simpler to use.

<b>Updated communication with CoCoA-4</b>

cocoa-4 and CoCoAServer communication has changed (you need the new
cocoa5.cpkg for CoCoA-4):
<span class=func>OperationCommunication</span> allows variable number
of arguments and sends the information to the server. So the function
myReadArgs in <span class=file>RegisterServerOps.C</span> now takes an
extra argument, <code>NumArgs</code>.
(added function linkability for the <span class=class>Frobby</span>
library, updated code
for <span class=file>TmpMayerVietorisTree</span>,
added <span class=func>NBM</span>)

<b>No more IsPositive/IsNegative for ZZ</b>

<i>2008-04-21</i>
<b>A few more matrix ops</b>
The <code>adjoint</code> function now works over every ring

Added some matrix norm functions (Frobenius, 1-norm, infinity-norm).
Added <span class=func>PseudoInverse</span> for full rank matrices.
Moved fns related to <span class=class>PPOrderings</span> into the new
file <span class=file>MatrixForOrdering.H/C</span>.

<b>Major revision of matrices</b>
New version: <span class=version>0.9917</span>

<b>Bug in RingDenseUPolyCleanImpl ctor</b>
A very well hidden bug has been fixed in

<b>Resuscitate RandomBitStream</b>
Make <span class=class>RandomBitStream</span> use GMP random number generator
(which in turn uses the <i>Mersenne Twister</i>).  Turned out to be easier

<b>Check indet names properly</b>
It should not be possible to construct rings where a symbol has an ambiguous
interpretation.  Perhaps even the arity of a symbol should be fixed in a ring
(<i>i.e.</i>you cannot have <code>x[1]</code> and <code>x[2,3]</code> in the
same ring).  One version of <span class=func>NewPolyRing_DMPI</span>
seems to check this
correctly but other pseudo ctors do not.  Abstract a checking fn, and rectify
the implementations.  Much the same applied to PPMonoids.

<b>Revise CoCoAServer</b>
CoCoAServer has been redesigned so that it is easier to add new functions.
The new design has vastly improved modularity, and should "scale well".  It
should make it easier for non-members of the CoCoA Team to add their
functions.  While the new design is surely a great improvement over the
old, evolutionary one, it cannot yet be regarded as stable.  After more
experience has been gained, the design will be reviewed.

<b>New code management structure</b>

<b>CoCoALib-0.98 Released</b>
After a long week of very intensive work by Abbott, Bigatti, Abshoff

has been released.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-03-07</i>
<b>Improved compilation flags</b>
Modified compilation flags (with <code>g++</code>): more stringent
warnings, and position independent code (almost never harmful, and
sometimes beneficial).
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-03-06</i>
<b>Dynamic Buchberger Algm</b>
First prototype of the Dynamic Buchberger's Algorithm. Uses a new way
to compute the pairs, but there is still a problem with the GM
criteria.  Added procedures for the lex comparison of Hilbert
functions, for use in the Dynamic Buchberger's Algorithm.  Implemented
the simplex algorithm, stage one.  This implementation uses the
CoCoALib matrices.  This implementation uses GMP integers, and is for
use in the Dynamic Buchberger Algorithm, NOT for huge optimization
problems.  Max.

<i>2007-03-06</i>
<b>Sugar and PosWDegTO</b>
in the case of PosWDegTO orderings, Grading dim is now set to 0 and

these cases.  Max.

<b>Interreduced non-homog GBasis</b>
In non-homogenous case, a new final stage interreduces the resulting
Groebner basis.  Max.

<i>2007-03-06</i>
<b>FacetComplex name clash</b>
The name <code>complex</code> clashes with a name from the standard library.
Changed our name to <code>FacetComplex</code>.  Max.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-03-06</i>
<b>Eliminate RingZ type</b>
There was a special C++ ring type for the ring of integers, viz. <code>RingZ</code>.
It did not appear to be of any great use in CoCoALib, and removing it did not
make any existing code significantly harder to read/comprehend.  Combined with
making RingZ a global value, the updated code actually becomes simpler and more
natural.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-03-06</i>
<b>Unique ring of integers</b>
After due deliberation we decided that Z, the ring of integers, and Q, the field of
rationals should be unique "pre-existing" structures in the CoCoALib C++ run-time
environment.  This will make life rather easier (and more natural) for users of the library.
Rather than use an <i>ad hoc</i> technique for managing these global values, we designed
and implemented a coherent scheme for managing them (see next task).
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-03-06</i>
<b>Management of Global Values</b>
A consequence of deciding to make the ring of integers a global value was the need to
manage such a global value properly.  The tricky part was ensuring the proper destruction
of RingZ before <code>main</code> exits.  Recall that C++ normally destroys globals after
main has completed, and that the order of destruction cannot easily be governed; destroying
values in the wrong order can cause to the program to crash just before it terminates.
Another advantage of forcing destruction before <code>main</code> exits is that it makes
debugging very much simpler.  And of course it is simply good manners to clean up properly
at the end of the program.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-03-05</i>
<b>Fix test-factor1</b>
Randomization means that <code>test-factor1</code> can appear to fail,
though it is behaving correctly.  Fixed it so that the random effects cannot
affect the validity.  Several other tests were cleaned up too.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-03-05</i>
<b>Remove "New" Prefix for some homomorphisms</b>
The <code>New</code> prefix on some homomorphism pseudo-constructors is not
useful and reduces readability of code using them.  Change the names of the
pseudo-constructors to eliminate the prefix, and ensuring that the resulting
code will be easily readable.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-03-05</i>
<b>Canonical Homomorphisms</b>
Implement <code>CanonicalHom</code> which allows easy creation of certain
canonical homomorphisms (and hopefully more readable code).  Document clearly
which cases are covered by <code>CanonicalHom</code>.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-02-27</i>
<b>Printing for DistrMPolyXXX objects</b>
The three DistrMPolyXXX implementations repeat virtually identical code for
printing out the polynomials.  This code could be moved up to SparsePolyRing
so that there is only a single copy BUT then DistrMPoly objects would no
longer be directly printable (for debugging).  Perhaps this would not matter if they were
not proper objects...?
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-02-20</i>
<b>Index of examples</b>
The "examples/" directory needs an index page to help find and
remind what the various examples illustrate.  There are two levels of index:
a brief "one-line" summary for each example, and a fuller description.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-02-08</i>
<b>Generate BuildInfo.C automatically</b>
Rather than generate BuildInfo.C automatically (which was deemed to be
a bit too dynamic), an equivalent effect can be achieved simply by
using special compilation flags for that one file.  This removes the
need for the ugly and complicated CXXFLAGS which we previously used
for all files.  In fact, CXXFLAGS was simplified further than expected:
all the tricky stuff is concentrated inside the special case for
BuildInfo.C.  CoCoAServer.C needed some minor adjustment.  A big
benefit is that the command for compiling against the CoCoA library
has become considerably simpler.  Added a new example, updated the
corresponding documentation.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-01-29</i>
<b>One line defns are obsolete</b>
Modify CoCoA4 so that one line fn defns produce an "obsolescent" warning,
and replace all one line defns in the packages by proper fn defns.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-01-24</i>
<b>Unify three PolyRingHoms</b>
The implementations of the three PolyRingHoms
(in the three different sort of SparsePolyRing) are virtually identical.  Now we
have polynomial iterators, it should be possibly to unify them into a single
implementation in SparsePolyRingBase.
Same thing for coeff embedding homs.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-01-18</i>
<b>Make TmpHilbertDir</b>
Make a separate directory for the Hilbert stuff.
Perhaps following the scheme used for the factorizer code.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-01-16</i>
<b>Rename "raw" args</b>
Improve readability/comprehensibility of code by using "suggestive"
names for fn args which are "raw" values.  This conversion generally
happens in parallel with other reviews of the code.  It will
eventually require a final "closing" assessment.  While the task is
simple, it is time-consuming to be sure that absolutely all changes
have been effected.  It does not seem possible to get the computer to
check that the task is complete.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-01-15</i>
<b>SmartPtr in RingHom</b>
Use SmartPtrIRC in RingHom, probably as a data member.
Was not as quick and simple as predicted, but did lead to an overhaul
of the code (esp. regarding printing of homomorphisms).
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-01-10</i>
<b>Use SmartPtrIRC in ring</b>
Put SmartPtrIRC in
rings, modules; substitute <i>ad hoc</i>reference counting with reuse
of SmartPtrIRC.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-01-11</i>
<b>Clean includes in header files</b>
Sutter's
coding conventions suggest using forward declarations instead of
including header files.  This makes (re)compilation faster, and
expresses more clearly the true dependencies in the code.  Task should
take at most 1 week, unless more unpleasant surprises surface.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-01-11</i>
<b>Fix typedef ring</b>
The use of a typedef for
[ring] causes trouble as a typedef cannot be forward declared as a
class can.  [ring] should become a trivial class forwarding all its
operations to a SmartPtrIRC data member.  Everything can be inline.
Task should take at most 1 day.
</p>

<p>
<i>2007-01-10</i>
<b>Attach old factorizer</b>
Attach old CoCoA4
factorizer to CoCoALib; mostly involves fiddling with makefiles and
the "build system".  A working factorizer was put in CVS for version
0.9713.  This stopgap solution should be enough for a few months.

<b>Migrate into SparsePolyRing</b>
The code for
ideal in the multivariate polynomial rings is essentially repeated
three times: simply copied for each of the specific ring
implementations.  This code should be migrated into SparsePolyRing, so
that just a single copy exists.  The migration should be possible, but
this must be verified.  It may also be possible for ideals in RingWeyl
to be covered by this same migrated generic implementation -- again
this must be assessed.  Time estimate: 3-7 days.
