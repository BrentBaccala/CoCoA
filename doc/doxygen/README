This is the README file for the directory CoCoALib/doc/doxygen/

Date: 3 May 2005

A copy of the doxygen-generated documentation is available online
for browsing or downloading; the URL is

http://cocoa.dima.unige.it/cocoalib/doc


To produce the doxygen-generated documentation:
- you need doxygen!  (see http://www.doxygen.org/)
- it will take some time and the directories are quite big!

make userdoc        generates documentation intended for a user
make developerdoc   generates documentation intended for a developer
make                generates both

[make publish    generates both, and copies them into the web site]
