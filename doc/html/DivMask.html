<P>
The main reason for creating a <CODE>DivMask</CODE> is to permit a quick, coarse
test of divisibility between power products -- but before you read on, you
might like to consider using <A HREF="PPWithMask.html"><CODE>PPWithMask</CODE></A> instead, which offers
essentially the same advantages with a *much more convenient interface*.
</P>
<P>
We say that <CODE>DivMask</CODE>s permit a "coarse" test because we accept as
responses <I>definitely not divisible</I> or <I>possibly divisible</I> (but
further checks must be conducted to decide for certain).
</P>
<P>
For example the radical of a PP .... (WORK-IN-PROGRESS)
</P>
<P>
<CODE>DivMask</CODE>s are
a fairly low-level concept, and probably of little use to most normal
CoCoALib users.  If you need to do conduct a great many divisibility tests
(between power products) and think you're interested, read on (assuming you
have already decided that <A HREF="PPWithMask.html"><CODE>PPWithMask</CODE></A> does not fulfill your needs).
</P>
<P>
Note: currently <CODE>DivMask</CODE>s cannot be used to ascertain coprimality (see Bugs section).
</P>
<P>
To use <CODE>DivMask</CODE>s you must master two concepts.  Firstly, the <CODE>DivMask</CODE>
itself is simply a bitset wrapped up in a class.  The size of the bitset is
determined at compile time.  There are various rules for how to set the
bits in the bitset, but they all satisfy the following guiding principle:
</P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	if <CODE>t1</CODE> divides <CODE>t2</CODE> then <CODE>(DivMask(t1) &amp; DivMask(t2)) == DivMask(t1)</CODE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P></P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<I>i.e.</I> <CODE>DivMask(t1)</CODE> is a "subset" of <CODE>DivMask(t2)</CODE>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P></P>
<P>
There are no other guarantees: in particular, the converse of the guiding
principle does not hold in general.
</P>
<A NAME="constructors"></A>
<H3>Constructors and pseudo-constructors</H3>
<P>
You can create five different sorts of <CODE>DivMaskRule</CODE>:
</P>
<P>
WORK-IN-PROGRESS: explain what a DivMaskRule is
</P>
<DL>
<DT> <CODE>NewDivMaskNull();</CODE></DT><DD>
    no bit is ever set (relatively fast, but otherwise pretty useless).
    (It is useful when a <CODE>DivMaskRule</CODE> is required and you know you
    won't use it)
<P></P>
<DT> <CODE>NewDivMaskSingleBit();</CODE></DT><DD>
    if the <CODE>k</CODE>-th exponent in the PP is strictly positive then the
    <CODE>k</CODE>-th bit is set: at most a single bit is used for each indeterminate,
    indets with <CODE>index &gt;= DivMask::ourMaskWidth</CODE> are ignored completely.
<P></P>
<DT> <CODE>NewDivMaskSingleBitWrap();</CODE></DT><DD>
    if the <CODE>k</CODE>-th exponent in the PP is strictly positive then the
    <CODE>k%DivMask::ourMaskWidth</CODE>-th bit is set: all indets are taken into
    account, and each bit is used for a set of indeterminates.
    This implementation is good when we have many indeterminates in
    supposedly sparse PPs.  (So far I don't have good examples with
    more than 2*ourMaskWidth indeterminates)
<P></P>
<DT> <CODE>NewDivMaskEvenPowers();</CODE></DT><DD>
    This rule may set several bits for a PP divisible by a "high" power of
    an indeterminate.  For instance, with a mask width of
    32 and 4 indets, up to 8 bits can be set for each indet: sets 1 bit if
    exponent is 1 or 2, set 2 bits if exponent is 3 or 4, etc. The actual number
    of bits set is <CODE>ceiling(exponent/2)</CODE>.
    This implementation is good when we have few indeterminates with
    high exponents (e.g. Buchberger's algorithm).
    It is equivalent to <CODE>SingleBitWrapImpl</CODE> if the number of indets is
    bigger than <CODE>ourMaskWidth</CODE>.
<P></P>
<DT> <CODE>NewDivMaskHashing();</CODE></DT><DD>
    this rule uses a hashing scheme to allow many bits to be set for each indet
    even when there are many indets.  The number of bits set for an indet
    is <CODE>ceiling(sqrt(exponent))</CODE>.
<P></P>
    Supposedly the implementation works well in all cases (e.g.  few
    indets and high degrees, or many indets and low degrees)
<P></P>
    For indet x the first bit set has index <CODE>x%ourMaskWidth</CODE>, and in
    general the k-th bit set has index <CODE>(x + k*hash2)%ourMaskWidth</CODE>.
    (See code for definition of hash2)

<H4>Operations with DivMaskRule</H4>
<P>
The type <CODE>DivMaskRule</CODE> is used to set the bits in a <CODE>DivMask</CODE> object.
The possible function calls are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>DMR-&gt;myAssignFromExpv(mask, exps, NumIndets)</CODE> 
   -- sets mask according to PP with exponent vector exps.
   Currently the parameter <CODE>exps</CODE> must be of type
   <CODE>vector&lt;SmallExponent_t&gt;</CODE>, but this may change.
<P></P>
  This function might be quite expensive and its cost depends on the
  <CODE>DivMaskRule</CODE>, but this is not a problem if it is called much more rarely
  than <CODE>IsSubset</CODE>.
<P></P>
<LI><CODE>DMR-&gt;myOutputSelf(out)</CODE>
</UL>

<A NAME="toc6"></A>
<H4>Operations with DivMask</H4>
<P>
The value of a <CODE>DivMask</CODE> object may be set any number of times (even using
different <CODE>DivMaskRule</CODE>s on each occasion).  Any two <CODE>DivMask</CODE>s may be
compared, but the result is meaningful only if both values were created
using the same <CODE>DivMaskRule</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
There are a few comparison functions on <CODE>DivMask</CODE> objects -- these are
guaranteed to be very fast and independent of the <CODE>DivMaskRule</CODE>,
unlike <CODE>myAssignFromExpv</CODE>
</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>dm1 == dm2</CODE>         -- true iff the bitsets are equal
<LI><CODE>dm1 != dm2</CODE>         -- false iff the bitsets are equal
<LI><CODE>IsSubset(dm1, dm2)</CODE> -- true if every bit set in dm1 is set in dm2
</UL>

<P></P>
<P>
You can read the bits held inside a <CODE>DivMask</CODE> object using this function:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>bits(dm)</CODE>  -- gives read-only access to the bitset inside the <CODE>DivMask</CODE>,
               the type of the result is <CODE>DivMask::mask_t</CODE> which is a
               typedef for a <CODE>std::bitset</CODE>.
</UL>

<P></P>
<A NAME="toc7"></A>
<H2>Maintainer documentation</H2>
<P>
The class <CODE>DivMask</CODE> is pretty simple: we don't use a naked
<CODE>bitset</CODE> to ensure that only a <CODE>DivMaskRule</CODE> can set the value.
Use of bitwise-and for modular reduction restricts <CODE>ourMaskWidth</CODE> to
being a power of 2.  There are no member functions, and just one
friend function (giving read access to the bitset):
</P>
<PRE>
     friend const mask_t bits(const DivMask&amp; dm);
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
The class <CODE>DivMaskRuleBase</CODE> is an abstract base class with an intrusive
reference count: every concrete divmask rule must be derived from this
class.  The virtual member function <CODE>myAssignFromExpv</CODE> must be defined in
each concrete divmask rule class: it should set the bits in the <CODE>DivMask</CODE>
argument according to the exponents specified in the other two arguments.
The virtual member function <CODE>myOutput</CODE> simply prints the name of the
divmask rule -- it might be useful during debugging.  The protected member
function <CODE>DivMaskRuleBase::myBits</CODE> simply allows write access to the
<CODE>bitset</CODE> held inside a <CODE>DivMask</CODE> value; I have to do it this way
because friendship is not inherited.
</P>
<P>
The type <CODE>DivMaskRule</CODE> is just a reference counting smart pointer to an
instance of a concrete divmask rule class.
</P>
<P>
The entire declarations and definitions of the concrete classes are in
the .C file.  There is no need for them to be visible in the .H file.
</P>
<P>
The class <CODE>DivMaskNullImpl</CODE> is quite simple.
</P>
<P>
The class <CODE>DivMaskSingleBitImpl</CODE> is also very simple.
</P>
<P>
The class <CODE>DivMaskSingleBitWrapImpl</CODE> is implemented assuming that the mask
width is a power of 2.  It is quite simple.
</P>
<P>
The class <CODE>DivMaskEvenPowersImpl</CODE> was (half) written by Anna while under the
influence of mind-altering drugs, I reckon.
</P>
<P>
The class <CODE>DivMaskHashingImpl</CODE> is a bit involved, especially regarding the
choice of bits to set.  I'm sure the heuristic can be improved (<I>e.g.</I> by actually
trying it on some real cases :-)  Currently the heuristic works as follows.
We consider each indeterminate in turn:
let <CODE>var</CODE> be the index of the indeterminate, and <CODE>exp</CODE> the exponent, then
the total number of bits to be set is <CODE>ceil(sqrt(exp))</CODE>, and
the first bit to be set will be in position <CODE>var%ourMaskWidth</CODE>
and subsequent bits will be in positions separated by multiples
of step (where step is <CODE>24*floor(var/ourMaskWidth)+13</CODE> -- this was chosen because
it happened to make <CODE>DivMaskHashingImpl</CODE> perform well in the CoCoALib tests).
</P>

<H2>Bugs, Shortcomings, and other ideas</H2>
<P>
Publicly visible use of <CODE>SmallExponent_t</CODE> is most unfortunate; how to fix it?
</P>
<P>
Define <CODE>operator&lt;=</CODE> for DivMasks, to do the same as IsSubset??
</P>
<P>
Should default <CODE>ourMaskWidth</CODE> be 32 or 64?
Surely most current processors are 64 bit now?
</P>
<P>
Is the restriction that <CODE>DivMask::ourMaskWidth</CODE> be a power of 2 reasonable?  Would we really
lose that much speed if any value were allowed?  Chances are that the
only interesting values are 32, 64 or 128 (which are indeed all powers
of 2).
</P>
<P>
COPRIMALITY:  Do we want <CODE>DivMask</CODE>s to permit a swift coprimality check?
Presumably the idea would be that two disjoint DivMask values would
imply that the corresponding PPs must be coprime.  Another possibility
is that the DivMask values are disjoint iff the PPs are coprime; this
second possibility would exclude some ideas for implementing DivMasks
(for instance <CODE>DivMaskSingleBitWrap</CODE> and <CODE>DivMaskHashing</CODE> would be excluded).
</P>
<P>
Documentation is too sarcastic.
