IMPORTANT NOTICE: please make sure you are using GMP 4.1.4 or later
(wrong results may be obtained with earlier versions).
</P>
<P>
Elements of a <CODE>RingTwinFloat</CODE> try to act as though they were unlimited
precision floating point values (while using only a finite precision).
RingTwinFloat uses a heuristic to monitor loss of precision during
computation, and will throw a <CODE>RingTwinFloat::InsufficientPrecision</CODE> object if
it detects an unacceptable loss of precision.  Beware that this is only
a probabilistic heuristic which can underestimate precision loss.  A
<CODE>RingTwinFloat::InsufficientPrecision</CODE> object may also be caught as an
<CODE>ErrorInfo</CODE> object having error code <CODE>ERR::InsuffPrec</CODE> (see <A HREF="error.html"><CODE>error</CODE></A>).
</P>
<P>
EXAMPLE:
  If epsilon is a non-zero <CODE>RingTwinFloat</CODE> value then (1+epsilon == 1)
  will either be false or throw <CODE>RingTwinFloat::InsufficientPrecision</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
<CODE>RingTwinFloat</CODE> uses a heuristic for guessing when the difference of two
almost equal values should be regarded as zero.  While the heuristic is
usually very reliable, it is possible to construct examples where the
heuristic fails: see EXAMPLES/ex-RingTwinFloat1.C.
</P>
<P>
The function <CODE>IsInteger</CODE> will return false for any value of magnitude
greater than or equal to 2^PrecisionBits(RR).  Recognition of integers
is heuristic; failures in ether sense are possible but are also
unlikely.

The constructor for RingTwinFloat takes a single argument being a lower
bound on the number of bits' precision desired (in the mantissa).  The
value specified is probably rounded up a bit; exactly what happens
depends on the mpf implementation in the GMP library.  A minimum
precision of 32 bits is imposed; smaller precisions are automatically
increased to 32.

<H2>Maintainer documentation for the classes RingTwinFloat and RingTwinFloatImpl</H2>
<P>
As usual the class <CODE>RingTwinFloat</CODE> is just a reference counting smart pointer
to an object of type <CODE>RingTwinFloatImpl</CODE> (which is the one which really does
the work).  The implementation of the smart pointer class <CODE>RingTwinFloat</CODE> is
altogether straightfoward (just the same as any of the other smart
pointer ring classes).
</P>
<A NAME="toc8"></A>
<H3>Philosophy</H3>
<P>
The implementation is based on Traverso's idea of "paired floats":
each value is represented as two almost equal floating point numbers.
The difference between the two numbers is intended to give a good
indication of how much "noise" there is in the values.  Here we shall
allow larger tuples of floating point numbers.  Arithmetic is 
performed independently on each component: e.g.
</P>
<PRE>
    (a[0],a[1]) + (b[0],b[1])  ==&gt;  (a[0]+b[0] , a[1]+b[1])
</PRE>
<P>
The consistency of the components is checked after every operation.
</P>
<P>
The main "trick" in the implementation of <CODE>RingTwinFloatImpl</CODE> is that its
elements are <CODE>MultipleFloat</CODE>s (just a C array of <CODE>mpf_t</CODE> values).  The
number of components in a <CODE>MultipleFloat</CODE> value is determined by
<CODE>RingTwinFloatImpl::myNumCompts</CODE> -- currently fixed equal to 2 at compile
time.  Furthermore the values of these components must all be very close
to each other.  Indeed the function <CODE>RingTwinFloatImpl::myCheckConsistency</CODE>
checks this condition: two outcomes are possible:
-  (1)  all the components are very close to each other;
-  (2)  at least one component is quite far from another.
-
In case (1) nothing more happens.  In case (2) it is evident that an
accumulated loss of precision has become unacceptable, and this triggers
an exception of type <CODE>RingTwinFloat::InsufficientPrecision</CODE>.  The addition and
subtraction functions check explicitly for near cancellation, and force
the result to be zero in such cases.
</P>
<P>
The bit precision parameter specified when creating a RingTwinFloat is used
in the following way (with the underlying principle being that elements
of <CODE>RingTwinFloat(N)</CODE> should have at least roughly N bits of reliable value).
</P>
<P>
The digits in the mantissa (of each component in a <CODE>MultipleFloat</CODE>) are
conceptually divided into three regions:
</P>
<PRE>
     A A A A...A A A  B B B B....B B B B  C C C....C C C
     &lt;-  N bits   -&gt;  &lt;- sqrt(N) bits -&gt;  &lt;- N/2 bits -&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
The region A comprises as many bits as the precision requested, and may
be regarded as being correct with high probability.
The region B comprises "guard digits": these digits are NOT regarded
as being correct, but regions A and B of all components must be equal.
Finally, region C is for "noise", and may be different in different
components.
</P>
<P>
When an integer is converted to a <CODE>MultipleFloat</CODE>, the component with
index 0 takes on the closest possible value to the integer while the
other component(s) have about sqrt(N) bits of uniform random "noise"
added to them (the random value may be positive or negative).
</P>
<P>
Special action is taken if there is large drop in magnitude during an addition
(or subtraction): if the magnitude drops by more than N+sqrt(N) bits
then the answer is forced to be equal to zero.  There is a remote chance
of erroneously computing zero when two almost equal values are
subtracted.  It does not seem to be possible to avoid this using limited
precision arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
Special action is taken if a "noisy" component happens to be too close
to the value at index 0: in this case more random noise is added.  This
can happen, for instance, if a value is divided by itself.
</P>
<A NAME="toc9"></A>
<H3>RingTwinFloatImpl::myFloor</H3>
<P>
It took me a while to find a satisfactory definition for the member
function <CODE>myFloor</CODE> (even though the final code is fairly simple).
</P>
<P>
I eventually settled on the following definition.  If the argument satisfies
the <CODE>IsInteger</CODE> predicate then the floor function must surely give
precisely that integer.  Otherwise the argument (call it <I>X</I>) is not an
integer, and the floor of <I>X</I>, if it exists, will be that integer <I>N</I>
which satisfies the two-part condition <I>N</I> &lt; <I>X</I> and <I>N</I>+1 &gt; <I>X</I>.  If
there is no such integer <I>N</I> then the floor cannot be computed, and an
<CODE>InsufficientPrecision</CODE> exception must be thrown.  In fact, there is an
obvious candidate for <I>N</I>, namely the floor of the first component of the
internal representation of <I>X</I> (it would be trickier to use the floor of the second
component).  Clearly <I>N</I> can be no larger than this candidate, since otherwise
the first part of the condition would fail; and if <I>N</I> were any smaller
then the second part would fail.
</P>

<H2>Bugs, shortcomings and other ideas</H2>
<P>
The code is ugly.
</P>
<P>
The functions <CODE>perturb</CODE>, <CODE>ApproximatelyEqual</CODE> and <CODE>myCmp</CODE> do "wasteful"
alloc/free of temporary <CODE>mpf_t</CODE> values.  <CODE>myCmp</CODE> can be done better.
</P>
<P>
What about a function which finds a continued fraction approximant to a
<CODE>RingTwinFloat</CODE> value?  It seems hard to implement such a function "outside"
<CODE>RingTwinFloatImpl</CODE> as <CODE>InsufficientPrecision</CODE> will be triggered long before
ambiguity is encountered in the continued fraction.
</P>
<P>
<CODE>myIsInteger</CODE> needs to be rewritten more sensibly (using <CODE>mpf_ceil</CODE> or
<CODE>mpf_floor</CODE> perhaps?)
</P>
<P>
How to print out floats when they appear as coeffs in a polynomial???
What are the "best" criteria for printing out a float so that it looks
like an integer?  Should the integer-like printout contain a decimal
point to emphasise that the value may not be exact?
</P>
<P>
Is it really necessary to call <CODE>myCheckConsistency</CODE> after multiplication
and division?  The accumulated loss of precision must grow quite slowly.
Yes, it is necessary: consider computing  1^1000000 (or any other high power).
</P>
<P>
What about COMPLEX floats???
</P>
<P>
When a <CODE>MultipleFloat</CODE> is duplicated should its components be perturbed?
</P>
<P>
AsMPF is an UGLY function: signature reveals too much about the impl!
</P>
<P>
<CODE>myNumCompts</CODE> could be chosen by the user at run-time; in which case it
must become a per-instance data member (instead of static).  I'd guess
that 2, 3 or 4 would be the best compromise.
</P>
<P>
Could it be useful to allow precisions below 32 bits?  The limit does
seem to be somewhat arbitrary.  Perhaps the number of noise bits should
also be allowed to vary?
</P>
<P>
<CODE>RingTwinFloatImpl::myOutput</CODE>:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the the number of digits printed could be determined by how closely
   the different components match -- would this be useful or wise?
<LI>the number of digits printed is related to the definition of
   <CODE>myCheckConsistency</CODE> (I'm a little uneasy about this invisible link)
</UL>

<P>
Should there be a means of mapping an element of a high precision <CODE>RingTwinFloat</CODE>
to a lower precision <CODE>RingTwinFloat</CODE> (without having to pass through an external
representation, such as a rational number)?
</P>
<P>
It seems wasteful to use two <CODE>mpf_t</CODE> values to represent a single <CODE>RingTwinFloat</CODE>
value.  Would it not be better to keep the main value and an "epsilon" (held as
a <CODE>double</CODE> and an <CODE>int</CODE> exponent?  Would it matter that "epsilon" has only
limited precision?
