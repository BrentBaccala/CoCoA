<H3>User documentation for the class DistrMPolyInlPP</H3>
<P>
If you are not a CoCoA library developer then most likely you should not
be considering using this class -- use a polynomial ring instead.  That
way you will gain ease of use and safety with only a small performance
penalty.
</P>
<P>
This class should be seen and used only by CoCoA library implementors;
normal users should use the polynomial rings (which internally may well
use DMPIs to represent their elements).
</P>
<P>
The class DistrMPolyInlPP implements multivariate polynomials
represented as ordered linked lists of summands, each summand is made up
of a coefficient (RingBase::RawValue) and a power product represented as
an order vector.
</P>
<P>
The implementation is oriented towards speed rather than safety or ease
of use.  To this end argument sanity checks (and other types too) should
normally use CoCoA_ASSERT rather than CoCoAError.

NO DOCUMENTATION YET WRITTEN.

<P>
This code is very ugly, and I am far from happy with it.  I hope it will
eventually become much cleaner while maintaining the speed.

<H3>Bugs and Shortcomings</H3>
<P>
The biggest bug is the definition of the struct summand which is NOT
PORTABLE since C++ compilers do not guarantee to respect the order of
fields in a structure.  I do not yet know how best to avoid this without
incurring a run-time penalty.
</P>
<P>
This code is apparently stable but surprisingly ugly and awkward to use.
I continue to hope that the same speed can be achieved with cleaner
code.  As an example of how bad the code is just take a look at the
function deriv (which computes derivatives) -- it is far too long and
incomprehensible.  There must be better way!
</P>
<P>
The classes DistrMPolyInlPP, PPMonoid and PPOrdering are more closely
tied together than I would really like.
</P>
<P>
Iterators are giving me headaches -- we need them, but they seem to
expose implementation details.
