<H2>User documentation for the files RingHom.H and RingHom.C</H2>
<P>
The class <CODE>RingHom</CODE> is intended to represent homomorphisms between rings.
Currently there is no way to represent more general maps between rings.
It is possible to create a <I>partial</I> homomorphism which can generate
run-time errors when applied to certain values.
</P>
<P>
The main operations available for <CODE>RingHom</CODE>s are application to a
<A HREF="RingElem.html"><CODE>RingElem</CODE></A>, and composition: both operations use function application
syntax (see below for details).

<H3>Applying a RingHom</H3>
<P>
A <CODE>RingHom</CODE> may applied using natural syntax:
-  let phi be an object of type <CODE>RingHom</CODE>
-  let x be an object of type <A HREF="RingElem.html"><CODE>RingElem</CODE></A>
-  let n be of type <CODE>long</CODE> or <CODE>int</CODE>
-  let N be an object of type <A HREF="BigInt.html"><CODE>BigInt</CODE></A>
-  let q be an object of type <A HREF="BigRat.html"><CODE>BigRat</CODE></A>
</P>
<PRE>
    phi(x)  applies phi to x; error if owner(x) != domain(phi)
    phi(n)  applies phi to the image of n in domain(phi)
    phi(N)  applies phi to the image of N in domain(phi)
    phi(q)  applies phi to the image of q in domain(phi)
</PRE>
<P>
In all cases the result is a <A HREF="RingElem.html"><CODE>RingElem</CODE></A> belonging to the codomain of
phi.  Currently <I>partial</I> homomorphisms are allowed, so applying a
RingHom could trigger an error (<I>e.g.</I> an induced hom from Q to Z/(3)
applied to 1/3).
</P>
<P>
If the <A HREF="RingElem.html"><CODE>RingElem</CODE></A> supplied belongs to the wrong <A HREF="ring.html"><CODE>ring</CODE></A> (<I>i.e.</I> not the
domain of the <CODE>RingHom</CODE>) then an exception is thrown with code
<CODE>ERR::BadRingHomArg1</CODE>.  If the argument belongs to the right <A HREF="ring.html"><CODE>ring</CODE></A> but
lies outside the domain then an exception with code
<CODE>ERR::BadRingHomArg2</CODE> is thrown.
</P>
<A NAME="toc8"></A>
<H3>Composition</H3>
<P>
Two <CODE>RingHom</CODE>s may be composed using a fairly natural syntax: if we have
two <CODE>RingHom</CODE>s phi:R -&gt; S  and theta:S -&gt; T then their composition may
be computed using the syntax
</P>
<PRE>
   theta(phi)   the composite homomorphism "apply phi first then theta"
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
If the domain of the outer homomorphism is different from the codomain of
the inner homomorphism then an exception is thrown with code
<CODE>ERR::BadCompose</CODE>.
</P>
<A NAME="toc9"></A>
<H3>Domain and Codomain</H3>
<P>
We may ask for the domain and codomain of a <CODE>RingHom</CODE> phi:
</P>
<PRE>
    domain(phi)       gives a const ref to the domain
    codomain(phi)     gives a const ref to the codomain
</PRE>
<P>
Note that the domain and codomain are merely <A HREF="ring.html"><CODE>ring</CODE></A>s, they "forget"
any special ring type (such as <A HREF="SparsePolyRing.html"><CODE>SparsePolyRing</CODE></A>).
</P>
<A NAME="toc10"></A>
<H3>Kernel</H3>
<P>
Currently it is not possible to ask for the kernel of a <CODE>RingHom</CODE>.
</P>
<A NAME="toc11"></A>
<H3>Member Functions for Operations on Raw Values</H3>
<P>
All operations on a <CODE>RingHom</CODE> are invisibly converted into member function
calls on a <CODE>RingHomBase</CODE>.  It is possible to call these member functions
directly: the main difference is that the member functions do not perform
any sanity checking on their arguments (so they should be slightly faster
but if you hand in incompatible arguments, you'll probably get an ugly
crash).
</P>
<A NAME="toc12"></A>
<H2>Maintainer documentation for the files RingHom.H and RingHom.C</H2>
<P>
These files contain two "generic" classes (<CODE>RingHom</CODE> and <CODE>RingHomBase</CODE>), and
a trivial concrete class representing the identity ring homomorphism,
<CODE>IdentityRingHom</CODE>.  Most of this section is dedicated to the two generic
classes since they represent the primary contribution to the CoCoA
library.
</P>
<P>
The class <CODE>RingHom</CODE> is little more than a "reference counting smart
pointer" class to objects of type <CODE>RingHomBase</CODE>; this latter type is
designed to support intrusive reference counting.  Beyond its role as a
smart pointer <CODE>RingHom</CODE> offers four "function application" syntaxes:
</P>
<PRE>
    RingElem RingHom::operator()(ConstRefRingElem x) const;
    RingElem RingHom::operator()(long n) const;
    RingElem RingHom::operator()(const BigInt&amp; N) const;
    RingHom RingHom::operator()(const RingHom&amp;) const;
</PRE>
<P>
The first three support a natural syntax for applying the homomorphism to a
ring element, a small integer, or a large integer.  The last offers a
fairly natural syntax for creating the composition of two homomorphisms.
</P>
<P>
The class <CODE>RingHomBase</CODE> is a purely abstract class which is used to specify
the interface which any concrete ring homomorphism class must offer.  In
particular this base class already includes an intrusive reference counter,
as required by <CODE>RingHom</CODE>.  It also includes two private data members
<CODE>myDomainValue</CODE> and <CODE>myCodomainValue</CODE> which store the domain and codomain
rings.  Note that these data fields are plain <A HREF="ring.html"><CODE>ring</CODE></A>s and so "forget" any
special ring type which the domain or codomain may have had.  Originally I
had hoped to preserve any special ring type information, but this seemed to
lead to a confusing and complex implementation (which probably would never
have worked as I hoped).  The two <A HREF="ring.html"><CODE>ring</CODE></A> fields may be read using the accessor
functions:
</P>
<PRE>
      const ring&amp; myDomain() const;
      const ring&amp; myCodomain() const;
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
A concrete class implementing a ring homomorphism must supply definition
for the following (pure virtual) functions:
</P>
<PRE>
      virtual void myApply(RingBase::RawValue&amp; image, RingBase::ConstRawValue arg) const;
      virtual void myOutputSelf(std::ostream&amp; out) const;
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
DO NOTE THAT the two arguments to <CODE>myApply</CODE> normally belong to
DIFFERENT rings.  <CODE>arg</CODE> belongs to <CODE>myDomain()</CODE> whereas <CODE>image</CODE>
belongs to <CODE>myCodomain()</CODE>.  The function <CODE>myOutputSelf</CODE> should
print out a useful description of the homomorphism.
</P>
<A NAME="toc13"></A>
<H2>Bugs, Shortcomings and other ideas</H2>
<P>
Cannot compute a kernel of a RingHom.
</P>
<P>
Arranging for <CODE>domain(phi)</CODE> and <CODE>codomain(phi)</CODE> to preserve C++ type
information about the respective rings (<I>e.g.</I> <A HREF="PolyRing.html"><CODE>PolyRing</CODE></A> or <A HREF="FractionField.html"><CODE>FractionField</CODE></A>
rather than simply <A HREF="ring.html"><CODE>ring</CODE></A>), appears to be difficult to achieve in any
reasonable manner.  I've decided that it is much simpler just to discard
all special type information, and return simply <A HREF="ring.html"><CODE>ring</CODE></A>s.  If the user knows
something more, he can use a "cast" function like <CODE>AsFractionField</CODE>.  Even
if it were feasible to maintain such C++ type info, there would have to
n-squared cases to cover all possible combinations of domain and codomain.
</P>
<P>
We should implement more special cases: <I>e.g.</I> same vars different coeff
ring, PP --&gt; PP, other...  Also need some way of handling canonical
homomorphisms.
</P>
<P>
Some special cases of homomorphic embeddings R --&gt; S:
(may belong with the special types of ring to which they are associated)
</P>
<UL>
<LI>(a) S is an identical copy of R
<LI>(b) S is the same (poly)ring as R but with a different term ordering
<LI>(c) R, S are the same polynomial ring (same vars and ordering)
     but with different coefficients
<LI>(d) each generator of R maps to a power product (or 0) in S
<LI>(e) S is the same as R but with more variables (is also of type (d))
<LI>(f) permutation of the variables  (is also of type (d))
<LI>(g) general homomorphism mapping
<LI>(h) S is the fraction field of R
</UL>

<A NAME="toc14"></A>
<H2>Some very old notes about implementing rings</H2>
<P>
This all needs to be sorted out!
</P>
<A NAME="toc15"></A>
<H3>Mapping elements between rings automatically</H3>
<P>
How to decide whether a value can be mapped into the current_ring?
</P>
<P>
If the rings are marked as being equivalent isomorphically then we
can just use the obvious isomorphism.  A more interesting case is
when a value resides in a ring which is a natural subring of the
current_ring e.g. Z inside Q(sqrt(2))[x,y,z].
</P>
<P>
One could argue that to create <CODE>Q(sqrt(2))[x,y,z]</CODE> we had to follow this path
</P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>Z</CODE> --&gt; fraction field <CODE>Q</CODE>
<LI><CODE>Q</CODE> --&gt; polynomial ring (1 indet) or DUP extension <CODE>Q[gensym]</CODE>
<LI><CODE>Q[gensym]</CODE> --&gt; quotient by gensym^2-2 to get <CODE>Q(sqrt(2))</CODE>
<LI><CODE>Q(sqrt(2))</CODE> --&gt; polynomial ring (3 indets) <CODE>Q(sqrt(2))[x,y,z]</CODE>
</UL>

<P>
From this it ought to be easy to identify natural embeddings of <CODE>Z</CODE>,
<CODE>Q</CODE>, and (possibly) <CODE>Q(sqrt(2))</CODE> in <CODE>Q(sqrt(2))[x,y,z]</CODE>.  We do
not get an embedding for Q[gensym] since we had to generate the symbol
<I>gensym</I> and no one else can create the same gensym.  Because of this
it is not altogether clear that an independently created copy of
<CODE>Q(sqrt(2))</CODE> can be embedded automatically, since that copy would
have a different symbol/gensym.  Now if the algebraic extension were
achieved directly...
</P>
<P>
Would we want <CODE>Q[x]/(x^2-2)</CODE> to be regarded as isomorphically equivalent
to <CODE>Q[y]/(y^2-2)</CODE>?  In fact there are two possible isoms:  <CODE>x &lt;---&gt; y</CODE>
and <CODE>x &lt;---&gt; -y</CODE>.  I think that these should not be viewed as isom
automatically, especially as there is more than one possible choice.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, if <CODE>R = Q[x]/(x^2-2)</CODE>, and <CODE>S = Q[x]/(36-18x^2)</CODE>, and
<CODE>T = Q[x]/(x^2-2)</CODE>.  It is clear that <CODE>Q[x]</CODE> can be mapped into
each of <CODE>R</CODE>, <CODE>S</CODE> and <CODE>T</CODE> in a natural way.  Of course, in each
case <CODE>x</CODE> stands for sqrt(2), and it wouldn't be too hard to spot
that <CODE>R</CODE> and <CODE>T</CODE> are <I>identical</I>; it is not quite as simple to see
that <CODE>R</CODE> and <CODE>S</CODE> are isom.  Presumably with a little more effort
one could create examples where it could be jolly hard to spot that
two such rings are just the same ring.  For this reason, I think no
attempt should be made to spot such <I>natural isoms</I> between
<I>independent</I> rings.  Had <CODE>T</CODE> been created from <CODE>R</CODE> (e.g. by
making copy via assignment) then they would no longer be independent,
and a natural isom could be deduced automatically.  Now I think about
it, a facility to make a copy of a ring WITHOUT the natural isom
should be made available.
</P>
<P>
There is also a need for a way to specify that one ring embeds
naturally into another (and via which homomorphism), or indeed that
they are isomorphic.  Isomorphism could be expressed by giving two
inverse homs -- the system could then check that the homs are inverse
on the generators, how it would check that the maps are homs is not so
clear (perhaps the only maps which can be created are homs).  Oooops,
this would allow one to declare that <CODE>Z</CODE> and <CODE>Q</CODE> (or <CODE>Z[x]</CODE> and
<CODE>Q[x]</CODE>) are isom..... need to think more about this!
</P>
<P>
A similar mechanism will be needed for modules (and vector spaces).
A module should naturally embed into a vector space over the fraction
field of the base ring....
</P>
<P>
Conceivably someone might want to change the natural embedding between
two rings.  So a means of finding out what the natural embedding is
will be necessary, and also a way replacing it.
</P>
<P>
There is also a general question of retracting values into <I>subrings</I>.
Suppose I have computed 2 in <CODE>Q(x)</CODE>, can I get the integer 2 from
this?  In this case I think the user must indicate explicitly that a
retraction is to occur.  Obviously retraction can only be into rings
<I>on the way</I> to where the value currently resides.
</P>
<P>
Other points to note:
</P>
<PRE>
  Q(x) = Z(x) = FrF(Z[x]) == FrF(FrF(Z)[x])
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
Q(alpha) = FrF(Z[alpha]) though denoms in Q(alpha) can be taken in Z
</P>
<P>
Q[alpha]/I_alpha = FrF(Z[alpha]/I_alpha)   <B>BUT</B> the ideal on LHS
is an ideal inside Q[alpha] whereas that on RHS is in Z[alpha].
Furthermore Z[alpha]/I_alpha is <I>hairy</I> if the min poly of alpha is not monic!
