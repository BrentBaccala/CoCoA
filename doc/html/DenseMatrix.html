<H2>User documentation for dense matrices (and DenseMatImpl)</H2>

<P>
A normal user should never need to know about the class DenseMatImpl; see
below for notes aimed at library maintainers.
</P>
<P>
An dense martrix object is a matrix represented in the most natural
way: as a <I>2-dimensional array</I> of its entries.  For instance a
DenseMat of 4 rows and 3 columns will contain 12=4x3 entries.
Contrast this with the a <CODE>SparseMatrix</CODE> where the values (and
positions) of only the non-zero entries are recorded.
</P>
<P>
To create a <CODE>DenseMat</CODE> you need to specify its ring R and dimensions
(<CODE>r</CODE> rows and <CODE>c</CODE> columns).  By default the matrix is filled with
zeroes; alternatively the entries may be initialized from a <CODE>vector</CODE>
of <CODE>vector</CODE>.
</P>

<PRE>
    NewDenseMat(R, r, c)    -- an r-by-c matrix filled with zero(R)
    NewDenseMat(R, VV)      -- a matrix whose (i,j) entry is VV[i][j]
</PRE>

<P>
To create a copy of a matrix, MatrixView, ConstMatrixView use the call
</P>

<PRE>
   NewDenseMat(M);
</PRE>

<P>
Currently a <CODE>DenseMat</CODE> has no special operations in addition to those
for a general <A HREF="matrix.html"><CODE>matrix</CODE></A>.  Here is a brief summary of those operations
</P>

<PRE>
    BaseRing(M)        -- the ring to which the matrix entries belong
    NumRows(M)         -- the number of rows in M (may be zero)
    NumCols(M)         -- the number of columns in M (may be zero)
  
    cout &lt;&lt; M          -- print out the value of the matrix
  
    M(i,j)             -- a copy of entry (i,j) in the matrix
    SetEntry(M,i,j,value)  -- set entry (i,j) of matrix M to value
</PRE>

<H2>Maintainer documentation for the class DenseMatImpl</H2>

<P>
The implementation is really quite straightforward (apart from keeping
proper track of <CODE>RingElemRawPtr</CODE>s when exceptions may occur).
</P>
<P>
<CODE>DenseMatImpl</CODE> is a concrete class derived from <CODE>MatrixBase</CODE> (see
<A HREF="matrix.html"><CODE>matrix</CODE></A>).  As such it supplies definitions for all pure virtual
functions.
<CODE>DenseMatImpl</CODE> represents the value of a matrix as an object of type
</P>

<PRE>
    vector&lt; vector&lt;RingElemRawPtr&gt; &gt;
</PRE>

<P>
The convention used is that the outer vector has an entry for each row,
and each inner vector contains the values of that row.  The indices of
a matrix entry correspond directly to the <CODE>vector&lt;&gt;</CODE> indices needed to
get at the value of that entry.  The advantage of using a vector of
vector is that resizing is relatively simple (compared to mapping the
entries into a single vector whose length is equal to the total number
of matrix entries).
</P>
<P>
Note that each entry in a <CODE>DenseMatImpl</CODE> is a <CODE>RingElemRawPtr</CODE>, so
care must be taken to handle exceptions in a way which doesn't leak
memory.
</P>
<P>
A <CODE>DenseMatImpl</CODE> object keeps explicit track of its own size (in the data
members <CODE>myNumRows</CODE> and <CODE>myNumColumns</CODE>).  This makes life easier when
handling matrices one of whose dimensions is zero.  The space overhead
should normally be utterly negligible.
</P>
<P>
Member functions accepting indices use CoCoA_ASSERT to check the
validity of the index values.  This is useful during debugging but
should cost nothing when compiled with debugging turned off.
</P>

<A NAME="toc3"></A>
<H2>Bugs and Shortcomings</H2>

<P>
Using <CODE>RingElemRawPtr</CODE> may not have been my brightest idea (because
it becomes hard to make all functions fully exception clean).
</P>
<P>
The pseudo-ctor from vector of vector should probably be a template fn;
this would offer better flexibility to the user (e.g. could initialize
from a vector of vector of int).
</P>
<P>
This is a first implementation: simplicity was paramount, efficiency
disregarded.
