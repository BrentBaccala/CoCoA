<P>
leak_checker is a standalone program included with the distribution
of the CoCoA library.  It can help track down memory leaks.  If you
have never used leak_checker before, it may be helpful to try the
small example given in the file debug_new.txt.
</P>
<P>
This program scans output produced by a program run either with the
debugging versions of <CODE>new/delete</CODE> (see <A HREF="debug_new.html"><CODE>debug_new</CODE></A>)
or using <A HREF="MemPool.html"><CODE>MemPool</CODE></A>s with debugging level set high enough that each
allocation/deallocation produces a verbose report (see <A HREF="MemPool.html"><CODE>MemPool</CODE></A>).
<CODE>leak_checker</CODE> pairs up every <CODE>free</CODE> message with its corresponding
<CODE>alloc</CODE> message, and highlights those <CODE>alloc</CODE> messages which do
not have a corresponding <CODE>free</CODE> message.  In this way probable memory
leaks can be tracked down.
</P>
<P>
To use leak_checker with the debugging version of global new/delete, see
the file <A HREF="debug_new.html"><CODE>debug_new</CODE></A> (which includes a small example to try).  To use
leak_checker with MemPools, you must compile with the CPP flag
CoCoA_MEMPOOL_DEBUG set -- this probably entails recompiling all your
code; see <A HREF="MemPool.html"><CODE>MemPool</CODE></A> for details.  In either case, with debugging
active your program will run rather more slowly than usual, and will
probably produce large amounts of output detailing every single
allocation/deallocation of memory -- for this reason it is best to use
smaller test cases if you can.  Put the output into a file, say <CODE>memchk</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
Now, executing <CODE>leak_checker memchk</CODE> will print out a summary of how
many alloc/free messages were found, and how many unpaired ones were
found; beware that leak_checker may take a long time if your program's
output details many allocations and deallocations.  The file <CODE>memchk</CODE>
will be modified if unpaired alloc/free messages were found: an
exclamation mark is placed immediately after the word ALLOC (where
previously there was a space), thus a search through the file memchk
for the string <CODE>ALLOC!</CODE> will find all unpaired allocation messages.
</P>
<P>
Each allocation message includes a sequence number (<CODE>seq=...</CODE>).  This
information can be used when debugging.  For instance, if the program
leak_checker marks an unpaired allocation with sequence number 500
then a debugger can be used to interrupt the program the 500th time
the allocation function is called (the relevant function is
either debug_new::msg_alloc or CoCoA::MemPool::alloc).  Examining the running
program's stack should fairly quickly identify precisely who requested
the memory that was never returned.  Obviously, to use the debugger it
is necessary to compile your program with the debugger option set: with
gcc this option corresponds to the flag <CODE>-g</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
WARNING: debug_new handles ALL new/delete requests including those arising
from the initialization of static variables within functions (and also
those arising from within the system libraries).  The leak_checker program
will mark these as unfreed blocks because they are freed only after main
has exited (and so cannot be tracked by debug_new).

<P>
This was formerly a C program (as should be patently evident from
the source code).  It requires a file name as input, and then scans
that file for messages of the form
</P>

<PRE>
  ALLOC 0x....
  FREED 0x....
</PRE>

<P>
(such messages are produced by the global operators new/delete in debug_new.C
and also by the verbose version of MemPool (with debug level &gt;= 3))
It then attempts to match up pointer values between ALLOC and FREED
messages.  Finally the file is scanned again, and any ALLOC or FREED
messages which were not matched up are modified by adding an exclamation
mark (!) immediately after the word ALLOC or FREED.
</P>
<P>
The matching process is relatively simplistic.  During an initial scan of
the file all ALLOC/FREED messages are noted in two arrays: one indicating
the type of message, the other containing the pointer value.  Initially the
two types are UNMATCHED_ALLOC and UNMATCHED_FREE, as the matching process
proceeds some of these will become MATCHED_ALLOC or MATCHED_FREE
(accordingly); obviously the types are changed in pairs.
</P>
<P>
The matching process merely searches sequentially (from the first entry to
the last) for pointer values of type UNMATCHED_FREE.  For each such value it
then searches back towards the first entry looking for an UNMATCHED_ALLOC
with the same pointer value.  If one is found, then both types are switched
to MATCHED_xxx.  If none is found, the UNMATCHED_FREE is left as such.  The
main loop then resumes the search for the next UNMATCHED_FREE to try to
pair up.  This approach does get slow when there are very many ALLOC/FREED
messages, but I do not see any simple way of making it faster.

<P>
This program gets painfully slow on large files.  It is also rather crude,
though quite effective at its job.
