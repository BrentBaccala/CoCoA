<H2>User documentation for the class RingFpImpl</H2>
<P>
The usual way to perform arithmetic in a (small, prime) finite field
is to create the appropriate ring via the pseudo-constructors
<CODE>NewZZmod</CODE> (or <CODE>NewQuotientRing</CODE> if you prefer) which are
documented in <A HREF="QuotientRing.html"><CODE>QuotientRing</CODE></A>.  These functions will automatically
choose a suitable underlying implementation, and you should normally
use them.
</P>
<P>
In some special circumstances, you may wish to choose explicitly the
underlying implementation.  CoCoALib offers three distinct
implementations of small prime finite fields: <CODE>RingFp</CODE> (described
here), and <A HREF="RingFpLog.html"><CODE>RingFpLog</CODE></A> and <A HREF="RingFpDouble.html"><CODE>RingFpDouble</CODE></A>.  Of these <CODE>RingFp</CODE> is
probably simplest and fastest implementation -- this file describes
how to create a <CODE>RingFp</CODE> implementation.
</P>
<P>
To create a <A HREF="ring.html"><CODE>ring</CODE></A> of this specific type use one of the pseudo-constructors:
</P>
<PRE>
    NewRingFp(p) -- p a machine integer or BigInt
    NewRingFp(I) -- I an ideal of RingZZ
    NewRingFp(p, res) -- p a machine integer, res is either ``GlobalSettings::SymmResidues`` or ``GlobalSettings::NonNegResidues``
</PRE>
<P>
These pseudo-constructors are for creating small prime finite fields; they
will fail if the characteristic is not prime or is too large: the error
signalled by throwing a <CODE>CoCoA::ErrorInfo</CODE> whose <I>code</I> is
<CODE>CoCoA::ERR::BadSmallFpChar</CODE>.  You can test whether an argument is
suitable by calling <CODE>IsGoodForRingFp</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
The default convention for printing residues is specified when you create
the <A HREF="GlobalManager.html"><CODE>GlobalManager</CODE></A>; you can also specify explicitly which convention to
use by giving a second argument to the pseudo-ctor <CODE>NewRingFp</CODE>.  Note
that the <B>internal representation</B> is always least non-negative
regardless of the output convention chosen.
</P>
<P>
If you seek a means for fast arithmetic in small finite fields consult
the documentation about <A HREF="SmallFpImpl.html"><CODE>SmallFpImpl</CODE></A>, <A HREF="SmallFpLogImpl.html"><CODE>SmallFpLogImpl</CODE></A>, and
<A HREF="SmallFpDoubleImpl.html"><CODE>SmallFpDoubleImpl</CODE></A>.  All arithmetic on elements of a <CODE>RingFp</CODE>
is actually carried out by a <CODE>SmallFpImpl</CODE> object.
</P>
<A NAME="toc2"></A>
<H4>NewZZmod or NewRingFp?</H4>
<P>
If <CODE>n</CODE> is a small prime then <CODE>NewZZmod(n)</CODE> produces the same result as
<CODE>NewRingFp(n)</CODE> (or perhaps <CODE>NewRingFpDouble(n)</CODE>).  If <CODE>n</CODE> is not a
small prime then <CODE>NewRingFp(n)</CODE> throws an exception whereas <CODE>NewZZmod(n)</CODE>
will produce a working quotient ring.

<H2>Maintainer documentation for the class RingFpImpl</H2>
<P>
The class <CODE>RingFpImpl</CODE> is a low-level implementation of (small
prime) finite fields; it is not intended for direct use by casual CoCoA
library users.
</P>
<P>
The class <CODE>RingFpImpl</CODE> is intended to implement small, prime finite
fields.  The constructor is more complicated than one might expect,
this is because the <CODE>RingFpImpl</CODE> object must store a little extra
information to fulfil its role as a <CODE>QuotientRingBase</CODE>.  Currently,
the characteristic must be prime (otherwise it wouldn't be a field)
and must also be small enough that its square fits into a
<CODE>SmallFpElem_t</CODE> (probably <CODE>unsigned long</CODE>, see the file config.H);
if not, an error is signalled.
</P>
<P>
Extreme efficiency is NOT one of the main features of this version;
contrast this with <CODE>SmallFpImpl</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
The class <CODE>RingFpImpl</CODE> derives from <CODE>QuotientRingBase</CODE>, which in
turn is derived from <CODE>RingBase</CODE>: see <A HREF="QuotientRing.html"><CODE>QuotientRing</CODE></A> and <A HREF="ring.html"><CODE>ring</CODE></A>
for more details.  Note that there is no <CODE>RingFp</CODE> class; a
<CODE>RingFpImpl</CODE> object can only be accessed as a <A HREF="QuotientRing.html"><CODE>QuotientRing</CODE></A>.
</P>
<P>
Note the use of "argument checking" static member functions in the ctor:
this is because <CODE>const</CODE> data members must be initialized before the main
body of the ctor is entered.
</P>
<P>
A member typedef <CODE>RingFpImpl::value_t</CODE> specifies the type used for
representing the value of an element of a <CODE>RingFpImpl</CODE>: this is a
typedef for <CODE>SmallFpElem_t</CODE> which is defined in config.H (to facilitate
tuning for different platforms).
</P>
<P>
The data members are those of a <CODE>QuotientRingBase</CODE> (which are used only
for answering queries about a <A HREF="QuotientRing.html"><CODE>QuotientRing</CODE></A>), plus the characteristic
of the field (held as an <CODE>value_t</CODE> in <CODE>myModulus</CODE>), and an auto-pointer
to a copy of the zero and one elements of the ring.
</P>
<P>
The zero and one elements of the ring is held in an auto_ptr&lt;&gt; for
consistency with the implementation of other rings -- in this simple
class it is not really necessary for exception safety.
</P>
<P>
This implementation is very simplistic: almost every operation is
delegated to the class <CODE>SmallFpImpl</CODE>.  The implementation class has been
separated so that its inline member functions can be used directly by
some other special case code (<I>e.g.</I> polynomials with SmallFp coeffs).
See <A HREF="SmallFpImpl.html"><CODE>SmallFpImpl</CODE></A> for details.  I note that the residues are
represented internally as the least non-negative value in the residue class
regardless of the user's choice of type of residue.
</P>
<P>
The largest permitted modulus for a <CODE>RingFpImpl</CODE> may depend on the
platform.  On a 32-bit machine the modulus must surely be less than
65536 -- refer to <A HREF="SmallFpImpl.html"><CODE>SmallFpImpl</CODE></A> for details.  A 64-bit machine may
allow larger characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Although it may seem wasteful to use heap memory for the values of
elements in a <CODE>RingFpImpl</CODE>, trying to make them "inline" leads to
lots of problems.  Originally we had implemented the values as "inline",
and the resulting problems delayed CoCoALib by almost a year.
</P>
<A NAME="toc5"></A>
<H2>Bugs, shortcomings and other ideas</H2>
<P>
Why does the class <CODE>RingFp</CODE> not exist?  Well, my current thoughts
are that since a <CODE>RingFp</CODE> would not do anything special which a
<A HREF="QuotientRing.html"><CODE>QuotientRing</CODE></A> cannot do, it seems needless extra complication to
create a "useless" class.  In particular, it cannot offer better
run-time performance.  If you want to compute quickly modulo a small
prime you must use <A HREF="SmallFpImpl.html"><CODE>SmallFpImpl</CODE></A> directly.
</P>
<P>
Probably <CODE>RingFp</CODE>, <A HREF="RingFpLog.html"><CODE>RingFpLog</CODE></A> and <A HREF="RingFpDouble.html"><CODE>RingFpDouble</CODE></A> could be replaced by
instances of a template class -- the template parameter would be
<CODE>SmallFpImpl</CODE>, <CODE>SmallFpLogImpl</CODE> or <CODE>SmallFpDoubleImpl</CODE> accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Why do all the member functions blindly forward their calls to the
<CODE>SmallFpImpl</CODE> member functions?  This means that the error message
for division by zero (say) will refer to <CODE>SmallFpImpl</CODE> rather than
<CODE>RingFpImpl</CODE>.  Does this really matter that much?  Obviously the
much same applies to <CODE>RingFpLogImpl</CODE> and <CODE>RingFpDoubleImpl</CODE>.
