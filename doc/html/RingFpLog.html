<H2>User documentation for the class RingFpLogImpl</H2>

<P>
The usual way to perform arithmetic in a (small, prime) finite field
is to create the appropriate ring via the pseudo-constructors
<CODE>NewZZmod</CODE> (or <CODE>NewQuotientRing</CODE> if you prefer) which are
documented in <A HREF="QuotientRing.html"><CODE>QuotientRing</CODE></A>.  These functions will automatically
choose a suitable underlying implementation, and you should normally
use them.
</P>
<P>
In some special circumstances, you may wish to choose explicitly the
underlying implementation.  CoCoALib offers three distinct
implementations of small prime finite fields: <A HREF="RingFp.html"><CODE>RingFp</CODE></A>, and
<CODE>RingFpLog</CODE> (described here) and <A HREF="RingFpDouble.html"><CODE>RingFpDouble</CODE></A>.  Of these
<CODE>RingFpLog</CODE> may be the fastest if your processor has slow division
instructions -- this file describes how to create a <CODE>RingFpLog</CODE>
implementation.
</P>
<P>
To create a <A HREF="ring.html"><CODE>ring</CODE></A> of this specific type use one of the pseudo-constructors:
</P>

<PRE>
    NewRingFpLog(p) -- Z ring of integers, p a machine integer or BigInt
    NewRingFpLog(I) -- Z ring of integers, I an ideal of Z
    NewRingFpLog(p, res) -- p a machine integer, res is either ``GlobalSettings::SymmResidues`` or ``GlobalSettings::NonNegResidues``
</PRE>

<P>
These pseudo-constructors are for creating small prime finite fields; they
will fail if the characteristic is not prime or is too large: the error
signalled by throwing a <CODE>CoCoA::ErrorInfo</CODE> whose <I>code</I> is
<CODE>CoCoA::ERR::BadSmallFpChar</CODE>.  You can test whether an argument is
suitable by calling <CODE>IsGoodFoRingFpLog</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
In the directory <CODE>examples/</CODE> there is a small example program showing
how small finite fields (with known implementation) can be created and
used: <CODE>ex-RingFp2.C</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
The default convention for printing residues is specified when you create
the <A HREF="GlobalManager.html"><CODE>GlobalManager</CODE></A>; you can also specify explicitly which convention to
use by giving a second argument to the pseudo-ctor <CODE>NewRingFpLog</CODE>.  Note
that the <B>internal representation</B> is always least non-negative
regardless of the output convention chosen.
</P>
<P>
If you seek a means for fast arithmetic in small finite fields consult
the documentation about <A HREF="SmallFpImpl.html"><CODE>SmallFpImpl</CODE></A>, <A HREF="SmallFpLogImpl.html"><CODE>SmallFpLogImpl</CODE></A>, and
<A HREF="SmallFpDoubleImpl.html"><CODE>SmallFpDoubleImpl</CODE></A>.  All arithmetic on elements of a <CODE>RingFp</CODE>
is actually carried out by a <CODE>SmallFpImpl</CODE> object.
</P>

<A NAME="toc2"></A>
<H2>Maintainer documentation for the class RingFpLogImpl</H2>

<P>
The class <CODE>RingFpLogImpl</CODE> is a low-level implementation of (small
prime) finite fields; it is not intended for direct use by casual CoCoA
library users.  Multiplication and division are effected using discrete
log/exp tables.
</P>
<P>
The class <CODE>RingFpLogImpl</CODE> is intended to represent small, prime finite
fields.  The constructor is more complicated than one might expect, this
is because the <CODE>RingFpLogImpl</CODE> object must store a little extra
information to fulfil its role as a <CODE>QuotientRingBase</CODE>.  Currently, the
characteristic must be prime (otherwise it wouldn't be a field).
Furthermore, the characteristic must also be less than 65536 even on
machines with 64-bit arithmetic -- larger values are prohibited as the
internal tables would become excessively large.  Creating a
<CODE>RingFpLogImpl</CODE> of characteristic p takes time roughly linear in p;
space consumption is linear in p.  An error is signalled if the
characteristic is too large or not prime.
</P>
<P>
Extreme efficiency is NOT one of the main features of this version.
</P>
<P>
The class <CODE>RingFpLogImpl</CODE> derives from <CODE>QuotientRingBase</CODE>, which in turn
is derived from <CODE>RingBase</CODE>: see <A HREF="QuotientRing.html"><CODE>QuotientRing</CODE></A> and <A HREF="ring.html"><CODE>ring</CODE></A> for more
details.  Note that there is no <CODE>RingFpLog</CODE> class; a <CODE>RingFpLogImpl</CODE>
object can only be accessed via a <CODE>QuotientRing</CODE>.
</P>
<P>
Note the use of "argument checking" static member functions in the ctor:
this is because <CODE>const</CODE> data members must be initialized before the main
body of the ctor is entered.
</P>
<P>
A member typedef <CODE>RingFpLogImpl::value_t</CODE> specifies the type used for
representing the value of an element of a <CODE>RingFpLogImpl</CODE>: currently
this is a typedef for <CODE>SmallFpLogElem_t</CODE> which is defined in config.H.
</P>
<P>
Essentially all operations are delegated to the class <CODE>SmallFpLogImpl</CODE>.
The two classes are separate so that the inline operations of
<CODE>SmallFpLogImpl</CODE> can be accessed directly in certain other special case
implementations (<I>e.g.</I> polynomials with coeffs in a SmallFp).  See the
documentation on <A HREF="SmallFpLogImpl.html"><CODE>SmallFpLogImpl</CODE></A> for details.  I note that the
residues are represented as the least non-negative value in the residue
class.
</P>
<P>
The data members are those of a <CODE>QuotientRingBase</CODE> (which are used only
for answering queries about a <A HREF="QuotientRing.html"><CODE>QuotientRing</CODE></A>), plus the characteristic
of the field (held as a <CODE>value_t</CODE> in <CODE>myModulusValue</CODE>), and an auto-pointer
to a copy of the zero and one elements of the ring.
</P>
<P>
The zero and one elements of the ring is held in an auto_ptr&lt;&gt; for
consistency with the implementation of other rings -- in this simple
class it is not really necessary for exception safety.
</P>
<P>
The largest permitted modulus for a <CODE>RingFpLogImpl</CODE> may depend on the
platform.  On a 32-bit machine the modulus must surely be less than
65536 -- refer to <A HREF="SmallFpLogImpl.html"><CODE>SmallFpLogImpl</CODE></A> for details.  A 64-bit machine may
allow larger characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Although it may seem wasteful to use heap memory for the values of
elements in a RingFpLogImpl, trying to make them "inline" leads to
lots of problems -- see <A HREF="RingFp.html"><CODE>RingFp</CODE></A> for more details

<H2>Bugs, shortcomings and other ideas</H2>

<P>
See also some comments in the "bugs" section of RingFp.txt.
</P>
<P>
The code is not very smart in the case of characteristic 2.
</P>
<P>
Run-time performance is disappointing.
</P>
<P>
I wonder if this code will ever prove useful to anyone.
