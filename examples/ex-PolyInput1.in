The first polynomial has 4 summands, the second 2.

The program knows that:
the first polynomial is in  Fpa = Z/(32003)[a[0],a[1],a[2]]
the second polynomial is in  Px = Fpa[x[0],x[1]]

2    1 2 0
the first entry is the (integer) coefficient of the summand
the other 3 entries are the exponents of a[0],a[1],a[2]
