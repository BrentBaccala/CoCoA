<h1 align=center>CoCoALib Examples</h1>

The programs in this directory form part of the documentation of CoCoALib.
They are self-explanatory and illustrative; they should be <i>read</i> (rather than
merely compiled and run).  Each one concentrates on certain features of CoCoALib.

<h3>Where to start</h3>

If you are completely new to the CoCoA Library then you should start
by looking at these examples which are the simplest and give an idea
of the "philosophy" behind the CoCoA Library:
<pre>
  ex-ring1.C
  ex-RingQQ1.C
  ex-RingElem1.C
</pre>

To compile all the example programs, just issue the command
<pre>
  make
</pre>
from inside this directory; or the command <tt>make examples</tt> from the COCOA_ROOT directory.

<p>
You can compile just one example (say <tt>ex-ring1</tt>) by executing:
<pre>
  make ex-ring1
</pre>


<h3>Writing Your Own Programs</h3>

An easy way to create your own program using CoCoALib is the following
<ul>
  <li>copy <tt>ex-empty.C</tt> into another file, say <tt>prog.C</tt></li>
  <li> write your code inside the procedure <tt>program</tt> in this copy</li>
  <li> compile your program with the command <tt>make prog</tt></li>
  <li> run your program with the command <tt>./prog</tt></li>
</ul>
